Feast or Famine is set in a semi dark age.  The people of the time are aware they are living in the shadow of civilization from the not too distant past.  The technology of the past age is mostly shunned or forgotten due to it's role in the 'Downfall'.  Society has broken down into into feudal hierarchies with lords providing protection in exchange for goods.  The technology of the age is semi-industrial and equivalent to mid 19th century.  

The island community of Rock Shoals is a small fishing community that has scraped a meager subsistence from the land.  The people of Rock Shoals mostly look to the sea and rarely leave the safety of their palisade to explore the interior of the island.
